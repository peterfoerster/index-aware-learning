The index-aware learning approach uses the dissection index to decouple a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a purely algebraic equation (AE). It then only learns the differential variables appearing in the ODE, and reconstructs the remaining algebraic variables from the differential ones using the AE. This ensures the consistency of the overall solution, as illustrated for the example circuit. (The colors in the circuit indicate to what extent the variables/devices appear in the ODE or AE respectively.)
